# Red Keyboard Mod

## The Story

While looking for music toys to circuit bend at an ARC thrift store in Colorado Springs, I came across a $1.49 little red keyboard.

One look, one play, one laugh, many ideas.

### Orignially...

I wanted to make the tiny thing a fat bass synth. Supersaw, PWM sweeps, resonant LPF ramps, hard sync...

### Then...

I got into eurorack years later. And that little red keyboard was still sitting on my shelf. And I had no CV+Gate keyboard...

### So...

I finally, after a lot of thinking, put together a PCB design in Upverter that I could purchase on OSHPark for about $70 for 3x and have at least three little projects.

Due to the price, and the risk of screwing up the first design, I made the thing as modular as possible, while still having a PIC16F690, an MCP4921, a power chip, and some multiplexers broken out.

I also broke out the key pads themselves to their own headers as I knew I'd need to use them again at some point.

## The Code

"As set forth by Morgan and Bartholomew", is right here.

Someday, there will be another board revision of sorts, and I'll rewrite some of this in STM32... but the code should still be here...

### PIC16F690

Why I used this chip? Because I had a dev board for it and figured, what the heck, it's probably enough for what I need... I should have used STM32 but, whatever: you **** with the **** you're born with.

I set the thing up to have

### Tuning Process

*Fresh flashes need at least one tuning reset to get things into the ballpark! It should actually be good enough for most purposes...*

This is the fun part (and while I'm finally writing this); there's a bunch of tricks, which I can never remember, to TUNE the silly thing. Here goes:

Hold two highest notes (High E and F) while turning the thing on to enter tuning mode.

Once in tuning mode, these keys do stuff:

```
High C = Pick next Lowest note
High D = Pick next Highest note

High C# = Tune current note DOWN
High D# (Eb) = Tune current note UP

Low C = Reset Tuning to some reasonable settings

Low G = Save tuning and exit tuning mode
```

### Serial output

Yeah, there's a serial console ut on this somewhere... that could help tuning a bit... but you should be able to struggle through it blind... right?
```
    // Setup serial: 9600bps 5v
    TRISBbits.TRISB5 = 1; // RX on pin 12
    TRISBbits.TRISB7 = 1; // TX on pin 10 (this is where you'll see what you're doing...)
```

## The PCB

Since this was the first large project I did on Upverter, it's still there. Mostly since Upverter doesn't have any resonable export tools. I wish I had spent the time learning KiCad instead, but so goes things.

Here's the PCB:
